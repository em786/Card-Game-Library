The library can be built by using the Deck, Hand, and Card java files. 
Deck - shuffles cards, creates deck
Card - specifies cards' value and suit as well as compares the value and suit of another card
Hand - replicates a player's hand in game
In this instance I created the files to be used in the Game.java file, but ran out of time.
